I live for making dreams come true, making sure that you will always feel like royalty and glamour’s and shining star when you walk into the room.

I also worked in Bridal Boutiques and frequently collaborate with other Couture Designers in my free time.

    	              		<p>Get all your ideas and inspiration together and connect with me by sending them through. When you’ve connected with me, we will discuss and interpret your ideas. I will then give you a quotation based on our collective ideas for your perfect outfit. Any changes and other ideas you desire afterwards can be added before the conclusion. As soon as you are happy with the final design (We mean truly happy), we will set up a tea date to take some measurements and go shopping for your fabric.</p>
